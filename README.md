Making plans for the next...

## Questions for Speakers

- Are your slides online?
- Do you need to use your own laptop for your demo?
- If so, we can pipe HDMI, mini display-port, and VGA to the projector. If you need something more arcane, please let us know.

## Questions for Attendees

- Are you or is someone you know building some Meteor based future tech? Come demo it at **Meteor London**. Create an issue, and we'll get in touch.
- What was your experience. If there was anything you loved or hated let us know. Post your thoughts in the issues.
- What would you like to see more of?
